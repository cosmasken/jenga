    content: `
      A Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) is a group of individuals who agree to meet 
      regularly and put money into a fund. Each round, one member receives the entire pool amount.
      
      With Bitcoin ROSCA, we bring this traditional savings method to the digital age using Bitcoin,
      enabling transparent, decentralized, and global participation.
